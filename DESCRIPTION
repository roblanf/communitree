Title: Tools for analysing community assembly in a phylogenetic context
Description: comatree is a package for understanding the process of community assembly 
    using phylogenetic trees. What you need is a dated phylogenetic tree, or a 
    distribution of such trees from a Bayesian analysis, that contains all of the species
    in the assemblage you want to focus on (e.g. all of the birds of New Zealand), and 
    all of their nearest relatives. Once you have that, you can use communitree to:
        * Estimate the number and timings of colonistaions of your assemblage
        * Find out which species are derived from each colonisation event
        * Estimate the number and timings of speciation events in your assemblage
        * Plot community assembly trees
        * Plot distributions of rates of colonisation and speciation in your assemblage
